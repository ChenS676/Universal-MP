# Universal MPNN

This repository contains the official implementation of Universal-MPNN, as presented in the paper [""]().

## Overview


## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```

## TODO 
- [chen] summarize the experiment 
    - [ ] identify the instability in train loop caused by matrix mismatch
    - [ ] achieve stable result 
    - [ ] complete result for cora, ddi, extend it to synthetic graph
    - [ ] check the detail of gat, gcn and all reformulate it in math
    - [ ] transfer MPLP, SEAL
    - [ ] present label trick
    - [ ] fast conclusion of the best architecture and useful design 
    - [ ] recheck dataloader, data split rate, 
- [german] submodule ogb, cora, tag and non-attribute graph
