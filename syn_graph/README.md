TODO List 10 Mar 2025

Carefully study the state of synthetic graph generation, including details of perturbation, the distribution of edges before and after, and statistical changes. Record observations and write them into a structured paragraph. Implement the experiments and report the results.  

Generate an automorphic symmetric graph and randomly add edges. You may refer to descriptions from relevant papers and quantitatively define the computation method for automorphism. The goal is to observe continuous changes as random edges are added.


在论文中记录这些工作，可以首先尝试在纸上写下，或者使用gpt. 来理清思路。
